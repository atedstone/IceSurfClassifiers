# IceSurfClassifiers

This repositorey contains code in active development for automated classification of ice surfaces using machine learning algorithms trained usingf ground-based spectroscopy and applied to multispectral images from UAVs and satellites.

There are no permissions associated with this code, it is unpublished and still under development. please do not use without permission.

## To Do

* Add option to save list of training versus test data, so that performance of a pickled classifier can be verified independently subsequently.
